This is a simple checklist when performing a release.

1. Ensure we're up-to-date with the current spec via `./spec_finder.py --diff-output --refresh-spec`
2. Update `README.md` with the current spec that we're up to
3. Update `README.md` to keep the install instructions on the right version
4. Update `<version>` in pom.xml
