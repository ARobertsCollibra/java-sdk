This is the Java implementation of [Open Feature](https://openfeature.dev). It is intended to be used in server-side contexts and has not been evaluated for use in mobile devices.

## Usage

There are a variety flag types that we offer, but `Boolean` provides the simplest introduction. We can use this SDK to 

```java
class MyClass {
    // ...
    public void myFunction() {
        if (client.getBooleanValue("redesign_enabled", false)) {
            return render_redesign();
        }
        return render_normal();
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Requirements
